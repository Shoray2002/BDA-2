thvlv6,1647697842.0,"Getting real tired of the whole ""innocent russians"" narrative."," Every goddamn day, after hearing sirens and explosions in my city and reading about thousands of civilians and hundreds of children dying I come to the internet to read about ""innocent russians"" who complain about having to ""suffer"" because of the actions of ""one person"". It's even worse when westerners, who have very little of what an average russian is, are trying to defend them.

 Ever since 2014 most russians have been shouting ""Crimea is ours!"", believing the most stupid, dumb-ass, idiotic russian propaganda (like: ukrainians are nazis, we crucified a little russian boy in Donetsk, we eat russian children, we exterminate russian-speaking citizens, etc). Every ukrainian had to deal with russian ukrainophobia (even before 2014), every ukrainian has been called a ""hohol"" (a disrespectful slur for ukrainians) by a russian, they always said how shit our country was and how nobody needed us. Even my friends who lived in russia have started to tell me these dumb lies from propaganda.

 And it's been so much worse since the full scale invasion has begun. Westerners probably haven't seen all this, so I'll try to explain how it's been trying to talk to russians since February 24:

1) Our own relatives didn't (a lot of them still don't) believe that we're being bombed, civilians were being killed, hospitals and kindergartens were destroyed etc. Pretty much every Ukrainian who has russian relatives can tell you a story like this right now. They choose TV, propaganda and Putin over their own relatives;

2) When ukrainians tried to reach out to russians and show them what horrific things their country has done over social media, russians started telling how it's either fake, or that \*we were all nazis who deserve it\* and they aren't ashamed of their country's actions;

3) They often told us that Ukraine was bombing their own cities Donbass, so we're the baddies, completely ignoring the fact that there was peace in Donbass until russians came, funded the separatists, gave them their own men and starting shelling Ukrainians; also, there's zero evidence that Ukrainians were shelling civilians; 

4) Some of them understood that what russia was doing was wrong, but they were just ""regular innocent people who couldn't do anything about it, why so much hate?"" (more on this later)

Now, I am also aware that there's been many russian bots over social media and I have ignored them for the most part. They aren't very good at what they do and their profiles are usually very obvious, so don't tell me that only the bots are bad, but ""real russians"" are the good guys. Cause the real people with real, old accounts also spewed this shit, and this includes bloggers, famous people etc. I will also mention that I used to work for a bot farm in Ukraine (not political), so it's not difficult for me to differentiate between bots and real accounts.

So, now about ""innocent russians"" and why they are not innocent. Let's start with civilians. I am aware  there are actually good russians, who understand the insanity of the situation, support Ukraine and protest their government. But I also have reason to believe that those russians are the minority of their people.

Some of you have seen the poll that shows \~70% of russians supporting putler and his actions. And most of you thought that this was just russian media lying, which is completely understandable. However, I think it's closer to the truth than we think. My arguments:

1) many older polls show similar support for putin and there weren't any big protests against him in russia, like in Ukraine and Belarus;

2) points 1-4 at the beginning of this post;

3) Very few people in russia have even said anything against the occupation of Crimea and Donbass, and most were in support of it, believing the legitimacy of referendums that took place there;

4) Very tiny percentage of russians are protesting now;

5) There are many street-interview style videos that show how most random people in russia support putin (weak statistic, but still). I may update the post later to include videos on the topic, when I have time.

All in all, we can't really know the truth but as of now *I have overwhelming evidence of the poll being true, and very little evidence of it not being true.*

**Russians should be protesting. Their country is a terrorists state which kills THOUSANDS of innocent civilians, but they care more about McDonalds, IKEA, TikTok and instagram.** Because that's where they are, not at protests. I've seen russians on twitter saying that they're the real victims, not Ukrainians, because they can't use spotify and buy games in steam. 

**And don't tell me that it's dangerous to protest there. I'm Ukrainian, hundreds of us died protesting.** I've been on Maidan myself, I protested too. So kindly fuck off with that one, they didn't fight for their freedom, they silently obeyed putin's regime, they are idly sitting at home right now -- they deserve the hate, then.

Now, about russian military. People say that only putin is the bad guy, **but who's shelling and shooting at civilians? Who's destroying homes, hospitals, kindergartens and schools? Who's dropping bombs on maternity homes and shelters? Who's pulling the trigger, KILLING CHILDREN? Not putin.** Russian army is as criminal as putin.

I don't care that they're brainwashed. The ship of my compassion to them has sailed long time ago. They are a cruel nation of terrorist and deserve every bit of hate they get right now. I'm sure that the tiny portion of good russians will understand.

2. Villagers plant Ukrainian flags on the 2 dry tanks.   
   
3. The other 2 tanks return, see the 2 dry tanks with Ukrainian flags, and open fire, destroying them both completely. Then they keep driving around looking for their other 2 tanks.   
   
4. One of them drives onto a bridge with a 5 ton weight limit.  The bridge collapses, the tank falls into the river below, and everyone inside the tank dies.    
   
5. The other tank keeps driving around, gets lost, and finally gets stuck in a ditch. Russian soldiers then get out of it and walk away.

tboc27,1646998943.0,"The ""West is weak and pathetic"" narrative only serves dictators and anti-democratic extremists.","Yesterday, I came across a highly upvoted post on this sub that claimed the West to be ""weak, pathetic and delusional"". The OP stated that the West has abandoned Ukraine and that we failed to intervene. The ruble lost 50% of its value in a week, NATO countries have provided Ukraine with billions and billions of support and pivotal intel. Ukrainian forces know where and when to ambush Russian supply convoys, because they are in close contact with western intelligence. Europe has accepted millions of refugees with open arms. This is not to take away any credits to the incredible fight that the Ukrainians are putting up. They are incredibly strong as a people, and they ""deserve"" to be part of the western geopolitical block. I'm deeply touched by how thousands of Ukrainians from all over the world returned to their country to defend it. But it's simply not true that Ukraine is not supported by us. Hell, over 22,000 volunteers are ready to give up their lives for Ukraine.

Stop spreading the narrative that western democracies are weak, pathetic or delusional. This narrative is deliberately created and spread by dictators such as Putin or Erdogan, or extremist right wing populists such as Orban that aim to destroy social values like gender equality or the democracy in itself. We are not weak. Putin is weak. We are not pathetic. He is. We are not delusional. He is. How else would you describe this weak attack on Ukraine? This pathetic attempt of an invasion? This delusional idea that somehow they would take Kiev in three days, while their soldiers have to steal chickens from Ukrainians two weeks in. We have nothing to learn from the autocracy. This month has proven how ""the strong man"" narrative is bullshit, and how it does not even begin to compare to the power of liberal democracies. Putin attempted to divide us. We have shown that we will crumble his oligarchy. We have our hands around his neck, and it's time to push the last breath of air out of his air pipe.

Zelensky has proven to be a good wartime leader, but his endless calls for a ""no fly zone"" over Ukraine are without substance. And he knows it. ""Don't fly over it, Russia"". ""Or else?"". Then we either do nothing, or we engage in the war immediately by shooting down Russian airplanes ourselves. Don't be mistaken. Ukraine has nothing to gain from military escalation. Ukraine does not want to become the main battleground for a Third World War. It has been through too much suffering in history. There will be no hiding when the conflict escalates. No steady influx from western support through stable countries such as Poland and Romania. Because those countries would be in war themselves. Right now, Ukraine benefits tremendously from a stable, war-free EU. The non-direct intervention of NATO is largely based on the nuclear arsenal of Russia. The moment Russia engages in nuclear attacks on Ukraine, the world as we know it, might be over. This is not a video game, every step should be considered fifty times in such crucial, dangerous times.

If you are in Ukraine right now, you ARE in a war zone. I know that it is hard to imagine right now. The park that you enjoyed yesterday might be a a deadly killing field tomorrow once a sniper takes up a position in the building where you had ice-cream as a kid. If you aren't in survival mode already, the sooner you engage it, the better your chances. Grab what you can. Leave the rest behind, your stuff is not worth dying for.

# Running

Running is the preferred option. You are now a war refugee, you have special rights. Even if you don't have a passport on you, just cross the border - at a checkpoint or by jumping a fence. Country that you eventually settle in will issue a special two-striped passport to you [Refugee travel document
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_travel_document).

Problem with running is that it makes vulnerable, if you are near the front line simply being in a moving vehicle will make you a target. Or you will get shelled or stopped/shot at a checkpoint. Either do it before it gets to this point, or don't do it at all.

Asses what kind of hardware you see around you:

- *Fast jets, missiles* - Front line is far away, run.

- *Helicopters, especially transport ones* - Decision point, if you don't go right now you will need to stay put.

- *Shelling or mortar fire* - Front line is less than 20 km from you. It isn't safe to be out anymore. Go into a basement and hunker down during the day. Unlike cruise missile attacks (there have been multiple today so far), shelling is persistent and lasts for hours or days.

- *Armoured vehicles* - You are in occupied territory. There will be checkpoints on the roads. Depending on their orders you might get turned around or just shot on sight.

The situation can change in hours. Just because it was safe to go out before you fell asleep, it doesn't mean it will be safe when you wake up.

# Staying put

Your priorities are as follows:

- Shelter. Basements in low rise buildings are ideal. You want to be out of sight, preferably in a place where a shell can explode on a higher floor and not bury you.

- Water. Fill up whatever containers you have with it. Once the electricity dies, your mains water will to. If there is snow outside, harvest it.

- Fuel. Whatever it takes to stay warm and melt snow. Coal or wood is preferable. 

- Food. Lowest on the priority list, but it will be first thing you will think of. Things above will kill you much sooner than starvation. Most of the time your morale will actually break before that point, hunger does really shitty things to people.

Russian forces are unlikely to have orders to massacre civilians, this doesn't mean that the 19 year old at the right end of a gun won't get trigger happy on you. Stay out of sight. 

Ukrainian government is apparently distributing weapons, having one for protection (as opposed to fight) is an extremely bad idea. It will make you an instant and legitimate target for any troops you might come across.

Stay safe, wherever you all are.

EDIT: Just to repeat what others are saying. Polish border is open and refugee camps are being set up. Claims that it is closed is fake news.

tvc9kq,1649000895.0,Russian state news agency published a piece calling for full blown genocide and destruction of Ukraine as a state,"**Trigger warning - this reads like Hitler's final solution.** I took the liberty of highlighting some parts of the article.

>Back in April last year we wrote about the inevitability of denazification of Ukraine. We do not need a Nazi, Banderan Ukraine, an enemy of Russia and an instrument of the West to destroy Russia. Today the issue of denazification has moved to the practical plane.  
>  
>**Denazification is necessary when a significant part of the people - most likely its majority - is mastered and dragged by the Nazi regime into its politics. That is, when the hypothesis ""the people are good - the government is bad"" does not work.** Recognition of this fact is the basis of the policy of denazification, of all its activities, and the fact itself constitutes its subject matter.  
>  
>Ukraine is in just such a situation. The fact that Ukrainian voters voted for ""Poroshenko's peace"" and ""Zelensky's peace"" should not be misleading - Ukrainians were quite happy with the shortest route to peace through blitzkrieg, which the last two Ukrainian presidents transparently hinted at when they were elected. It was precisely this method of ""pacification"" of internal anti-fascists - through total terror - that was used in Odessa, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariupol and other Russian cities. And it suited the Ukrainian average citizen quite well. **Denazification is a set of measures towards the Nazified mass of the population, which technically cannot be directly punished as war criminals.**  
>  
>**Nazis who have taken up arms must be destroyed as much as possible on the battlefield. No significant distinction should be made between the AFU and the so-called National Security Forces, as well as the territorial defence militias that have joined these two types of military formations**. All of them are equally engaged in outrageous cruelty against civilians, equally responsible for the genocide of the Russian people, and they do not observe the laws and customs of war. **War criminals and active Nazis must be punished approximately and exemplarily.** A total lustration must be carried out. Any organisations that have linked themselves with the practice of Nazism must be eliminated and banned. **However, in addition to the top brass, a significant portion of the masses of the people who are passive Nazis, collaborators of Nazism, are also guilty**. **They supported and indulged the Nazi government. Just punishment for this section of the population is possible only as the bearing of the inevitable burdens of a just war against the Nazi system, waged as gently and discreetly as possible against civilians**. The further denazification of this mass of the population consists in re-education, which is achieved by ideological repression (suppression) of Nazi attitudes and harsh censorship: not only in the political sphere, but necessarily also in the sphere of culture and education. It was through culture and education that the profound mass Nazification of the population was prepared and carried out, consolidated by the promise of dividends from the Nazi regime's victory over Russia, Nazi propaganda, internal violence and terror, and the eight-year war with the rebel Ukrainian Nazi people of Donbass.  
>  
>Denazification can only be carried out by the victor, which presupposes (1) his unconditional control over the denazification process and (2) the power to ensure such control. In this respect, the denazified country cannot be sovereign. The denazifying state - Russia - cannot proceed from a liberal approach to denazification. The ideology of the denazifier cannot be challenged by the guilty party undergoing denazification. Russia's recognition of the need for denazification of Ukraine means the recognition that the Crimean scenario is impossible for Ukraine as a whole. However, this scenario was also impossible in 2014 in the rebellious Donbass. Only eight years of resistance to Nazi violence and terror led to internal cohesion and a consciously unequivocal mass refusal to preserve any unity and connection to Ukraine, which defined itself as a Nazi society.  
>  
>**The time frame for denazification can in no way be less than one generation who must be born, grow and mature under the conditions of denazification**. The Nazification of Ukraine has lasted for over 30 years - starting at least in 1989 when Ukrainian nationalism gained legal and legitimate forms of political expression and led the movement for ""independence"" towards Nazism.  
>  
>The peculiarity of modern Nazified Ukraine is its amorphous and ambivalent nature, which allows Nazism to be disguised as aspirations for ""independence"" and a ""European"" (Western, pro-American) path of ""development"" (in reality, degradation). (in reality - to degradation), to claim that ""there is no Nazism in Ukraine, only private sporadic excesses"". There is no main Nazi party, no F√ºhrer, and no full-fledged racial laws (only a stripped-down version in the form of repression of the Russian language). As a consequence, there is no opposition and no resistance to the regime.  
>  
>However, all of the above does not make Ukrainian Nazism a ""light version"" of German Nazism of the first half of the twentieth century. On the contrary - as Ukrainian Nazism is free from such ""genre"" (political technology in essence) frames and restrictions, it unfolds freely as the fundamental basis of all Nazism - like European and, in its most developed form, American racism. Therefore, denazification cannot be carried out in a compromising way, on the basis of a formula such as ""NATO - no, EU - yes"". The collective West itself is the designer, source and sponsor of Ukrainian Nazism, while the Western Bandera cadres and their ""historical memory"" are only one of the instruments of the Nazification of Ukraine. Ukronazism is no less of a threat to peace and Russia than German Nazism of Hitler's modification.  
>  
>**The name ""Ukraine"" cannot apparently be retained as the title of any fully denazified state formation on territory freed from the Nazi regime.** **The People's Republics newly established in Nazi-liberated territory must and will grow out of the practice of economic self-government and social welfare, the reconstruction and modernisation of the population's life-support systems.**  
>  
>Their political aspirations in fact cannot be neutral - redemption of guilt towards Russia for treating it as an enemy can only be realized in reliance on Russia in the processes of reconstruction, regeneration and development. No ""Marshall Plan"" for these territories should be allowed. There can be no ""neutrality"" in the ideological and practical sense compatible with denazification. The cadres and organisations that are the instruments of denazification in the new denazified republics cannot but rely on the direct power and organisational support of Russia.  
>  
>**Denazification will inevitably be de-Ukrainianisation - a rejection of the large-scale artificial inflation of the ethnic component of the self-identification of the population of the territories of historical Malorossia and Novorossia**, which the Soviet authorities started. As a tool of communist superpower, artificial ethnocentrism did not remain orphaned after the fall of communism. In this service capacity, it was taken over by another superpower (power over states) - the superpower of the West. It needs to be returned to its natural boundaries and stripped of its political functionality.  
>  
>Unlike, say, Georgia and the Baltic countries, Ukraine, as history has shown, is impossible as a nation state, and attempts to ""build"" such a state inevitably lead to Nazism. **Ukrainianism is an artificial anti-Russian construction with no civilizational content of its own, a subordinated element of a foreign and alien civilization**. Debanderization in itself will not be enough for denazification - the Banderite element is only a performer and a screen, a disguise for the European project of Nazi Ukraine, so the denazification of Ukraine is also its inevitable de-Europeanization.  
>  
>**The Banderovian top brass must be eliminated, it is impossible to re-educate them. The social ""swamp"" that actively and passively supported it through action and inaction must survive the hardships of the war and assimilate the experience as a historical lesson and atonement for its guilt**. Those who did not support the Nazi regime, who suffered from it and the war it unleashed in Donbass, must be consolidated and organised, must become the support of the new government, its vertical and horizontal. Historical experience shows that wartime tragedies and dramas benefit peoples who have been seduced and carried away by the role of Russia's enemy.  
>  
>Denazification as the goal of the special military operation itself is understood as a military victory over the Kiev regime, the liberation of territories from armed supporters of Nazification, the elimination of intransigent Nazis, the capture of war criminals and the creation of the systemic conditions for subsequent peacetime denazification.  
>  
>The latter, in turn, should begin with the organisation of local self-government, police and defence bodies cleansed of Nazi elements, launching on their basis the founding processes of the new republican statehood, integrating this statehood in close cooperation with the Russian denazification agency (newly created or remade, say, from Rossotrudnichestvo), with the adoption under Russian control of a republican regulatory framework (legislation) for denazification, defining boundaries and frameworks directly In this respect Russia should act as a custodian of the Nuremberg process.  
>  
>**All of the above means that in order to achieve the goals of denazification, the support of the population, their transition to Russia** after being freed from the terror, violence and ideological pressure of the Kiev regime, after being removed from the informational isolation, is necessary. Of course, it will take some time for people to recover from the shock of military action and to become convinced of Russia's long-term intentions - that ""they will not be abandoned"". It is impossible to foresee in advance in which territories this mass of population will constitute a critically needed majority. ""The Catholic province"" (Western Ukraine, comprising five regions) is unlikely to be part of the pro-Russian territories. The line of exclusion, however, will be found by experience. A hostile to Russia, but forcibly neutral and demilitarised Ukraine, with formally banned Nazism, will remain behind it. Russia-haters will go there. A guarantee that this residual Ukraine will remain neutral should be the threat of an immediate continuation of the military operation if the listed requirements are not met. This would probably require a permanent Russian military presence on its territory. From the alienation line and up to the Russian border would be the territory of potential integration into Russian civilisation, anti-fascist in its inner nature.  
>  
>Ukraine's denazification operation, which began with a military phase, will follow in peacetime the same logic of stages as a military operation. At each of them, irreversible changes will have to be achieved, which will be the results of the corresponding stage. The necessary initial steps of denazification can be defined as follows:  
>  
>**Liquidation of the armed Nazi formations (understood to mean any armed formations of Ukraine, including the Armed Forces of Ukraine), as well as the military, informational and educational infrastructure supporting their activity;**  
>  
>The formation of people's self-government and police (defence and law and order) in the liberated territories, protecting the population from the terror of underground Nazi groups;  
>  
>\-installation of the Russian information space;  
>  
>**-Removal of educational materials and prohibition of educational programmes at all levels that contain Nazi ideological attitudes;**  
>  
>**-massive investigations into personal responsibility for war crimes, crimes against humanity, dissemination of Nazi ideology and support for the Nazi regime**  
>  
>**-The listing, disclosure of the names of collaborators of the Nazi regime and their forced labour to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure as punishment for their Nazi activities (from among those who will not be subject to the death penalty or imprisonment);**  
>  
>\-Adoption at the local level, under Russian curatorship, of primary denazification regulations ""from below"", banning all types and forms of revival of Nazi ideology;  
>  
>\-Establishing memorials, commemorative signs, monuments to the victims of Ukrainian Nazism, commemorating the heroes of the struggle against it;  
>  
>The inclusion of a set of anti-fascist and denazification norms in the constitutions of the new People's Republics;  
>  
>**-Creation of permanent denazification bodies for a period of 25 years.**  
>  
>Russia will have no allies in denazification of Ukraine. **As this is a purely Russian affair. And also because not just the Bandera version of Nazi Ukraine will be eradicated, but also and above all Western totalitarianism, imposed programs of civilizational degradation and disintegration, mechanisms of subordination to the superpower of the West and the USA.**

>In order to implement the plan of denazification of Ukraine, Russia itself will have to finally give up its pro-European and pro-Western illusions, to realize itself as the last instance of protection and preservation of those values of historical Europe (Old World), which deserve it and which the West ultimately abandoned, having lost in the struggle for itself. This struggle continued throughout the twentieth century and manifested itself in the World War and the Russian Revolution, inextricably linked to each other.  
>  
>Russia did everything it could to save the West in the twentieth century. It realised the main Western project, the alternative to capitalism which defeated the nation-states - the socialist, red project. It crushed German Nazism, the monstrous spawn of the crisis of Western civilisation. The last act of Russian altruism was Russia's outstretched hand of friendship, for which Russia received a monstrous blow in the 1990s.  
>  
>Everything Russia has done for the West, it has done at its own expense, by making the greatest sacrifices. The West eventually rejected all these sacrifices, devalued Russia's contribution to resolving the Western crisis, and decided to take revenge on Russia for the help it unselfishly provided. From here on, Russia will go its own way, without worrying about the fate of the West, building on another part of its legacy: leadership in the global decolonisation process.  
>  
>As part of this process, Russia has high potential for partnership and alliance with countries that the West has oppressed for centuries and have no intention of putting its yoke back on. Without Russian sacrifice and struggle, these countries would not have been liberated. The denazification of Ukraine is at the same time its decolonisation, something the Ukrainian population will have to realise as it begins to free itself from the ghosts, temptations and dependencies of the so-called European choice.

t0a4o0,1645706580.0,I am sorry for this war. I am Russian.,"Dear ukrainian

I've never posted in this sub, but now I think that it is time to do this. I am not seeking your forgiveness here, because I know, that the actions of my own country can't be forgiven, starting from 2014, and, therefore, I am too, because every country's government at some point represents its own people. My attempts to prevent my government from committing these crimes have failed, and now I have almost nothing left to do to stop this government.  


My wish is not for you to understand, that not every Russian supports this war, because almost every decent Russian media have said something against the war.  I just want for you to know, that we will still fight, despite this bloody, immoral and disgusting regime. Thank you for staying against this country!

t1wsjy,1645881095.0,"Putin is furious and Ukraine has a fighting chance, here‚Äôs why","From @RihoTerras (member of the European Parliament) from twitter:
‚ÄúIntel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin‚Äôs lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.

Russians didn‚Äôt have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can‚Äôt physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months ‚Äì if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians ‚Äì women and children ‚Äì to sow panic. This is their trump card.

Russia‚Äôs whole plan relies on panic ‚Äì that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.

The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!‚Äù",766,9001,frsgrn,/r/ukraine/comments/t1wsjy/putin_is_furious_and_ukraine_has_a_fighting/,Russian-Ukrainian War

I'll be honest - I got quite disturbed by the seen, which I didn't want to believe happens in Ukraine, so I started to research more. And I couldn't help but notice:

&#x200B;

CNN, BBC, The Washington Post, NY Times, and other reputable sources are reporting constantly from Ukraine-Poland border. Yet, I do not see any reports of wrongdoings. Why is that? Only a handful of sites report such things, sites that are not well known. Why do we not fact-check first? It's the first rule of informational hygene.

&#x200B;

And yes, there's a bit of struggle, a LOT of people are trying to leave, and the lines are longs, and the wait is hard. But I don't see any reports of such atrocities.

&#x200B;

2) Video authenticity.

Let's take info from this article:

[https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/indians-students-fleeing-ukraine-brutally-beaten-by-forces-at-borders-563156.html?fbclid=IwAR1M4-fYePw\_9Q8anYWlkn\_ZG9eqxWoMWqC85RZAx3og60H21HiMb0EOrY8](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/indians-students-fleeing-ukraine-brutally-beaten-by-forces-at-borders-563156.html?fbclid=IwAR1M4-fYePw_9Q8anYWlkn_ZG9eqxWoMWqC85RZAx3og60H21HiMb0EOrY8)

&#x200B;

\- Video quality is like from 2000 - is it specifically made to avoid capturing any details? Who, having filmed something in 2022 would have such crappy quality?

&#x200B;

\- This one: [https://twitter.com/ashoswai/status/1497904152663498752?s=20&t=YBFwIC7FXZLaW54QgdISaQ&fbclid=IwAR0QtnBdtL7K42umQpGwm2zOI54MWY\_92Oeuir4sAV9tKSCjivdY9NFIwJ4](https://twitter.com/ashoswai/status/1497904152663498752?s=20&t=YBFwIC7FXZLaW54QgdISaQ&fbclid=IwAR0QtnBdtL7K42umQpGwm2zOI54MWY_92Oeuir4sAV9tKSCjivdY9NFIwJ4)

On the background you can hear \*Russian\* language, not \*Ukrainian\*. And it's important, because in western Ukraine (you know, where Poland is), no one speaks Russian, and only Ukrainian. Secondly, because of a lot of russian diversants (soldiers) trying to sabotage from inside, the President has ordered army/police/etc. to talk only in Ukrainian.

&#x200B;

\- This one:

[https://twitter.com/defencealerts/status/1497939053982851073?s=20&t=gA\_Mmtw4bvosEsiqQP3Mkw&fbclid=IwAR3nN6q9f78PqGef1bqxl6oO03di\_Ld4Mx\_V5F3WXeSd8qSNYPdOWqL--zg](https://twitter.com/defencealerts/status/1497939053982851073?s=20&t=gA_Mmtw4bvosEsiqQP3Mkw&fbclid=IwAR3nN6q9f78PqGef1bqxl6oO03di_Ld4Mx_V5F3WXeSd8qSNYPdOWqL--zg)

Quality again horrible (like on purpose). But if you look at the snippet of the car's licence plate (attached), it's not Ukrainian. You can see 3 numbers in the middle, whereas Ukrainian plates have either 4 or 5 numbers + letters.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle\_registration\_plates\_of\_Ukraine?fbclid=IwAR0zxC53NiJUTepkB89NetLrE6oFXdHbArVmrn-J8Os83BkBEMZhh7zKYfA#Current\_2015\_plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Ukraine?fbclid=IwAR0zxC53NiJUTepkB89NetLrE6oFXdHbArVmrn-J8Os83BkBEMZhh7zKYfA#Current_2015_plates)

[License plate from the video: NOT Ukrainian](https://preview.redd.it/itfoxup84jk81.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1f1cf995e170d1c29ba88a019c8ff96cb613ce6)

\- With regards to both videos:

What indicators do you see there suggesting it's Polish border? How about indicators of Ukrainian army? Not even clear which country it's in. How about anything that would prove any fact mentioned? Only words. Only some blurry video, of someone kicking someone, somewhere.

&#x200B;

\- All in all, maybe apart from Indians talking on background (which I cannot verify), every other claim made has zero ground.

&#x200B;

3) Apart from the dodgy video, other sources of ""information"" are just words of some random people.

&#x200B;

Ukraine has been living fighting misinformation from Russia every day since 2014. We're being called many things, we're blamed for the current invasion of our country, there's all.

Vishyvanka is the name of National Costume of  Ukraine. This is differentiated from others because of its embroidery  work which features Ukrainian embroidery. Vishyvanka is a plain white  shirt made of linen and decorated with floral or ornamental hand-sewn  embroidery. And the speciality of the costume is that it is worn by both  men and women.

t9hhd0,1646748192.0,US to ban Russian oil and gas.,"## Biden expected to ban Russian energy imports today

**From CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Jeremy Diamond, Kevin Liptak and Phil Mattingly**

US President¬†Joe¬†Biden is expected¬†to today¬†ban Russian oil, natural gas and coal¬†imports¬†to¬†the US, according to¬†three sources familiar with the decision.

The US will make the move unilaterally, without its European allies, due to disagreement among European nations about whether to ban Russian energy. EU countries have significantly more exposure to Russian energy than the US.¬†¬†

US officials decided, given the extreme political pressure at home, they could move without the coalition and not create major issues.¬†

Biden is expected to address the news at 10:45 a.m. ET.",1263,7550,IllegalBallot,/r/ukraine/comments/t9hhd0/us_to_ban_russian_oil_and_gas/,News

This includes references to American political parties, opinions about each other in reference to Ukraine, social media post statistics according to political sway and so on.

Folks this is a war. NOT an election. This has literally NOTHING to do with American politics. ""but that party supported that."" or ""but that President didn't do this, so we're in this mess"" or ""this party supports this so we're better than you! You're all monsters"" or ""my neighbors belong to x party so that means they don't support Ukraine, but at least I have a flag for Ukraine out so I'm awesome"" or ""if you don't think talking about American politics here and around this war is relevant, you're na√Øve and I'm super-smart for saying so""  is not helping the people of Ukraine. Political party banter does not help the children or the women or young people who are being shot at, shelled, or bombed. It just devolves into stupid cat fights in the comments.

""But we have to think long-term and discuss this on here"" is irrelevant. This is r/Ukraine not r/AmericanPoliticalArguments.

People are dying out there. If you want to discuss American (or any non-American for that matter) politics go over to r/poitics. Don't crowd up this sub with irrelevant political banter about political party opinion and bias about each other and hate over past or current American political leaders around the war in Ukraine. This just devolves into political bantering and worthless pictures and articles about things that have zero value in helping support the people of Ukraine and their military.

Show some respect and true support for Ukraine and its people. American politics are not welcome here. Right now we need to show American unity. Forget what your neighbors think. Forget what party each other belongs to. That's not relevant right now. Let's find ways to support Ukraine together and drop political differences about the past or about now or the future.

**EDIT:** Yes America is one of Ukraine's biggest supporters. Bickering about our politics doesn't do anything for them. Instead we should be posting about and discussing ways to help Ukrainian refugees, ways to send support as civilians in our capacities, and cheer Ukrainian military victories and western national support over there (like many Americans and others have already!). Talking about what America is sending in supplies is one thing. Arguing about what Presidents past or present have done or peoples' political positions next door does nothing right now to help these people.

So, today there is finally an official confirmation of what your editors knew before - information about the successful operation of the Naval Forces of Ukraine, which managed to accomplish the impossible (which, by the way, no one has been surprised for a long time) and destroy the pride of the Nazi Black Sea Fleet - the newest patrol ship of the project 22160 ""Vasily Bykov"".

Yesterday, this rocket-armed colossus, exceeding in its combat potential everything that the Ukrainian Naval Forces have in terms of surface forces, came under attack from Ukrainian naval rocket artillery. It happened in the Odessa region.

The ship sank today. There is no information about the fate of the crew.

&#x200B;

I feel a mixture of sadness and anger.

&#x200B;

First she lost her home, then she lost her father, now she lost her life.

&#x200B;

She did not take up arms. She was not a soldier. She did not pose a threat to anyone.

&#x200B;

She was a lovely and peaceful 25 year old woman with so much potential. She was intelligent, beautiful, and hardworking. She was a polyglot. She was a gamer. She loved music.

&#x200B;

I already miss her so much.

&#x200B;

Fuck Putin, and fuck the coward who bombed my friend's house. I hope they both become compost for sunflower fields.

tffeal,1647429825.0,"We were told we will get helmets and vests, but instead we were sent to ""look it up"" - Please help us in the Kyiv Territorial Defenses","# A small introduction

My name is Dinka Kay and I‚Äôm a YouTube content creator: [http://YouTube.com/c/DinkaKay](http://youtube.com/c/DinkaKay), League Of Legends Partner, and an Overwolf's Spokesperson...

My mom is Lina Klebanova, a known Ukrainian journalist/activist who took a significant part in the 2014 revolution on Maidan, and who also produced the Oscar Nominated movie ""Winter on Fire""([https://www.netflix.com/il-en/title/80031666](https://www.netflix.com/il-en/title/80031666)) (IMBd - [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6572770/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6572770/))

She stayed in Kyiv to help with the evacuation of children and elderly, but now, due to corporate incompetence, she now also has to purchase life saving equipment for Kyiv's Territorial Defenses, because no one else will do it.

[Oscar nominated movie \\""Winter on Fire](https://preview.redd.it/6hz55b4pcqn81.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc5e6af83829c5f85b492975d2f86f682e30de2)

Kyiv's Territorial Defenses has been completely fucked over by these so called ""Foundations"" who promised us non-lethal equipment such as: Knee protectors, helmets, bullet proof vests, walkie-talkies, uniforms, boots etc'‚Ä¶ They claimed they sent it, but up until now, none of it reached Kyiv.In fact, we even reached out to ask about it, but received a:

‚ÄúWe sent you fuck ton of equipment ... Go look it up‚Äù - as a response.

[ \\""We sent you fuck ton of equipment ... Go look it up\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/v1pgv22ucqn81.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=11602207d20280a68509ea6c778735abdc8f9c7b)

So mom, knowing that her loved ones are in the Territorial Defense, had decided to take it upon herself to get them the equipment that will protect them, because apparently those big fancy companies can't be trusted and we don't have ""7-14 business days"" to receive equipment that we needed 2 weeks ago.

The equipment is certified, and we're purchasing it locally in Poland to receive it as fast as we can (we have a licensed logistics corridor from Poland that brings it all), but we can only buy in bulk. Minimum bulk purchase is 250 units, and one 'Class IV - armor + helmets' kit costs 707 euros.

**We have about 400 man in Kyiv alone.**

So right now we're buying what we can with what money we're donated, and so far we've managed to equip 28 of our fighters - that's 28 out of 400.

So here I am, reaching out to you people of Reddit to see if you could help us help our boys.

[ LEFT: My mom, Lina Klebanova, with our kitty Matilda + the helmets we purchased RIGHT: Our Territorial Defenses boys in their new helmets ](https://preview.redd.it/wzpz4y1xcqn81.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad58b3293d28ebef4d8d4b78251bcb046e2f7dd7)

Here is the GoFundMe my husband opened up on my behalf (I'm not a US citizen): [https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kyivs-territorial-defenses?utm\_campaign=p\_cf+share-flow-1&utm\_medium=copy\_link&utm\_source=customer](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kyivs-territorial-defenses?utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=customer)

We need more than 300,000 Euros but are starting with one unit (28 people) which comes out to just over 19,000 Euros, which is why the goal is $20,000. Of course we hope we can reach a total sum of $330,090 to help all the units in Kyiv.

**EDIT**:\[16.3.22\] GoFundMe took our fundraiser down while they verify us, it can take up to 3-4 business days according to their email. We reached out to them via Email and Twitter ([https://twitter.com/DinkaKay/status/1504121494300942340](https://twitter.com/DinkaKay/status/1504121494300942340))... Please help retweet and comment so they will notice it if you can.

[The email we received from GoFundMe after they took down our campaign  ](https://preview.redd.it/jnk7ry55nrn81.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c7deddb8701f296877c4f0de28cff3a2364262)

It's been hours and r/gofundme still haven't responded. One of their claims was that: ""we are getting equipment for soldiers"" when in reality everyone knows we have nothing to do with the Ukrainian military.  In fact, if we are, we wouldn't've been crowd funding to begin with!

[Fundraising is not allowed for any supplies to 'soldiers'](https://preview.redd.it/d4u47cdxesn81.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0057ff9fc1ecc840663dd7590d2371deae8a672)

On top of that, r/gofundme's ""offer"" was to **GIVE OUR SUPPORTERS DONATIONS TO A DIFFERENT FUND OR ORGANIZATION**, as if this is **OUR** money to give away on others behalf.

[\\""we are offering the option to select a registered charity or non-profit organization to deliver the funds to or invite them to have the funds transferred directly\\""](https://preview.redd.it/onnnemcbfsn81.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=219da0872b78e9e6cac7e65f7f3f061d786e2628)

I hope r/gofundme does the right thing, and allows all of us help our loved ones. We're not soldiers, and we're not mercenaries. If we were, we would've been receiving our own funding and wouldn't've resorted to crowd funding in the first place.

Still waiting, but rest assured that if the campaign will get cancelled, everyone will be refunded from 3-7 business days. For now, if you would still like to donate, here is my PayPal: [https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/dinkakay](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/dinkakay)

\[17.3.22\] Here's a short video I made: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbnDFwO87o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbnDFwO87o)

\[19.3.22\] PayPal finally joined Ukraine which means now my mom can also open a PayPal!Unfortunately PayPal only allows Ukrainians to have personal accounts, but not Businesses accounts, so I guess I will keep receiving funding to my account and just transfer it to my mom's PayPal instead (which is still a lot better than dealing with the bank) or buy items directly through the companies that she will provide with. (which will make life a lot more easier) - I wanted to do PayPal today but they were dealing with heavy shellings so hopefully we'll do it tomorrow.

**There's also a chance we might get the GoFundMe campaign back up so cross your toes and fingers!**

Also due to high demand, we're looking into making a crypto wallet, luckily I have the right people to take care of that so stay tuned!

While waiting on the GoFundMe donations, I managed to transfer some of the PayPal donations into my account (the rest has been put on hold by PayPal - I've spoken to them - they're taking care of it - Due to Holiday + Weekend I'm forced to wait for 3 days until I can proceed with anything.) Once mom will finally buy all the equipment, she'll take images and videos of everything!

[Mom and Matilda taking photos, videos, around the city for a future video I'll make once I'll have all the footage \(I still need images and videos of all the equipment she'll purchase with the donations\)](https://preview.redd.it/4g2e96jed8o81.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=949d6036a4b9e56593273526aaa396557f5b83de)

For now, the funds that we received straight into her bank account through SWIFT (before this post was even made) have been already used for field medicine kits and helmets!  She said she'll make an organized list of everything once she gets the items so you will all see the transactions!

[On the top left my moms friend who's a soldier helping us out, and some helmets and field medicine that have been purchased](https://preview.redd.it/lt5zxl3gc8o81.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8d172b1c0d091b3a4015cc419eb3f12403f457)

As always, I will keep updating you all here and on Twitter. Thank you all who have contributed so much already!

Besides [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DinkaKay), I now also make stories (made a story folder called '[Ukraine War](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17901835715473442/)') on Instagram regarding the ongoing situation on our end: [https://www.instagram.com/dinkakay/](https://www.instagram.com/dinkakay/)

\[20.3.22\] The GoFundMe campaign was brought back up - hopefully it will stay that way. We weren't notified, and no changes have been made to it. (we were asked to edit the campaign and make it clear that it was not for a ""militray purpose"" - we sent them all the material but it remained the same)

We emailed them to make sure this was not some sort of mistake.

**CAN'T BELIEVE WE REACHED THE GOAL!** Unfortunately, the campaign is still under review by GoFundMe - so I'll update once we get a response! Thank you so so much for helping us out, and cross your toes and fingers that we'll be able to use the donations!

\[21.3.22\] GoFundMe did not allow us to raise funds for the Kyiv's Territorial Defense and we had to change it to humanitarian/medical aid **only** \- something that is still very much needed.

[The GoFundMe campaign was originally for Kyiv's Territorial Defense and their life saving equipment, but due to their issues with Military equipment \(even if it's for self defense\) it had to be changed. ](https://preview.redd.it/tqct9xpp8mo81.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcd6ca4237da140bc51af9ad354e0143a9d84c1e)

If you would like a refund for money donated through GoFundMe, it's completely understandable, just reach out to me in private but note once the money has been pulled out of the campaign we cannot refund you. We have 24 hours until all donations made are final. All donors will have received an update through us on GoFundMe. **I also sent DM's to each and every one of you who reached out through Reddit.**

[\\""All donors will have received an update through us on GoFundMe\\""](https://preview.redd.it/f3xu70uxlmo81.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9a8e2e0382a7c2554618d9523d8b85ea3d6ffb)

\[23.3.22\] \*\*Our GoFundMe campaign is being held hostage.\*\*We reached our goal, but r/gofundme is not releasing the funds and isn't responding to any of our emails. Not only that, but they also raised our goal from $20,000 to $30,000 without us asking. We asked them to bring it down to the original goal, but now we reached their new goal of $30,000 and they still haven't responded.

https://preview.redd.it/307yz76ct7p81.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=eea519fb41504f501031ed501dec16e3b6ac50c6

On top of that r/paypal is not releasing the funds we got from Hold and claiming we need to ""ask for a request"" in 30 Days.  I explained to them that we're in a middle of war and my volunteers need the rest of the donations to purchase their equipment... And that if one of their employees managed to release $1200, I know they can release the rest but choosing not to.

Now is not the time for bureaucracy!

The little bit I did manage to get out of PayPal about $5,834.77 were transferred to my mom earlier today.

We've also spoken to **SpotFund**, who were suggested to us by a fellow Redditor who's running a campaign through them right now. They agreed to our terms and said they could host us and our campaign after the whole GoFundMe Debacle gets resolved.

https://preview.redd.it/tel7e6v6w7p81.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=2130bd05c474683357096997cf97eff711bc9655

\[24.4.22\] - \[26.4.22\] **PayPal released our funds - closing GoFundMe to refund everyone - opened a new fund with SpotFund instead**

After contacting PayPal through every single social media, [PayPal Support](https://twitter.com/AskPayPal) reached out to me and asked for full details so they could investigate the situation. On that same day they took the donations off of 'hold' and I managed to send it all to my mom. So thank you r/paypal for understanding the situation and adapting to current global events.

**Unfortunately the same can't be said about** r/gofundme\*\*.\*\*After 10 days of us reaching out to them, we've been told to provide \*\*more ""\*\*documents"" to:""verify the list of individuals responsible for their distribution so they could deliver a document for us to sign.""

[ \\""This option requires that you submit the full legal names of all individuals responsible for the distribution of aid. Have you sent this information and I missed it?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/rjyghles8up81.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=4870c18d73c86b12d0efe812dfc8b04ee49e4efb)

The ""list of individuals"" is literally my mom and her team of volunteers. SHE is the buyer and SHE is the distributor. We have told them that time and time again but I guess they just enjoy making people miserable.

As a company who needs so much ""verifications"" they never even cared to ask for her ID, email, number or cared to speak to her. Hell, I sent PayPal a full folder of those ""verifications"" a week ago and it was already re-solved.

**So we're shutting down the campaign, and have chosen to have all donations on GoFundMe be refunded,** what a waste of time and effort.

To make this whole thing even more ridiculous, our Government recognized helmets and vests as humanitarian aid, as well as many other crowd funds and companies.

\*\*And Speaking of sane Crowd Fund companies, SpotFund is officially hosting us!\*\*So hopefully those of you who will receive your refunds could transfer it here instead.This time for **both** Helmets/Vests and Medications.
