This is not an ancient fake with a ""militia man crucified on the cross"" and not a dubious ""night shooting of civilians on the way out of Mariupol."" The terrorist does not hide his face, and definitely belongs to the ""defenders of Ukraine"".

In the video, a representative of the Ukrainian army executes a person in the most cruel way, accusing the person of having links with Russia (!).  At the end of the video, the murderer says ""Glory to Ukraine, death to enemies"".

In order to avoid blocking, we do not upload the video to ourselves, but give a link to it (without a preview). Children, teenagers and people with a weak mind are categorically not recommended to watch this. However, the world must definitely see it!

# The ""six downed russian planes""

Several ukranian media outlets reported six russian planes being downed. ([link](https://www.dialog.ua/war/246979_1645695687))

However, the photos ([1](https://www.dialog.ua/images/news/249bfc1602a43af27a955467e5147284.jpg), [2](https://www.dialog.ua/images/content/ad6a53d7d578232990c24d212d50bc1b.png)) were actually flipped version of a generic photo of a burning plane which [was used on the web well before the invasion](https://web.archive.org/web/20220110122243/https://x-files.site/news.php?readmore=9729).

Other, more recent [reports](https://t.me/voyna_novost/18216) show similar tactics: reusing an [old photo](https://web.archive.org/web/20210119113222/https://infosmi.net/events/192329-v-voyne-v-karabahe-azerbaydzhan-poteryal-odin-su-25/) to claim that ""a russian aircraft has been destroyed"". ([another one](https://twitter.com/GeneralStaffUA/status/1500540992893640708) from the Ukrainian MoD: [reused photo](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D1%83-24_%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8) of a Su24 downed by Turkey in 2015).

# The ""soldier burned alive""

The [video](https://i.imgur.com/H5iCbH1.png) in question indeed has several men in uniform torturing another man and then setting him ablaze. 

However, this video first resurfaced several years ago, and was [frequently used](https://web.archive.org/web/20220307194459/https://ok.ru/video/186557468962) as propaganda by both sides of the conflict, given the unidentifiable uniform and insignia of the participants.

# The ""helicopter bombing Mariupol""
This [photo](https://i.imgur.com/ooY6R3C.png) circulating Telegram is titled as ""Russian aviation attacking civilian areas of Mariupol"". This one needs little explanation - those are not rockets shooting perpendicularly (!) from the helicopter, but [IRCMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_countermeasure) - flares that protect aircrafts from heat-seeking missiles.

# The ""photos of the destroyed russian tanks""

While many photos may as well be true, those two photos ([1](https://i.imgur.com/58vo6y9.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/5pDThUN.png)) are [from 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150204165319/https://www.unian.net/war/1040296-silyi-ato-unichtojili-podrazdelenie-iz-16-tankov-boevikov-pod-debaltsevo-fotoreportaj.html) and have nothing to do with the current conflict.

# The ""Russian MiGs bombing Kyiv""
This [video](https://web.archive.org/web/20220224145752/https://twitter.com/ASBMilitary/status/1496861905478111238) is titled ""Russian aircrafts bombing civilian areas near Kyiv"", but, according to the link to the tweet to the video, ""Russians don‚Äôt use this old [aircraft] config & only Sukhois [aircrafts] were reported the entire time from Russian side.""

Another similarly titled [video](https://www.tiktok.com/@granica_ru_uk/video/7068152732477181186) on TikTok reuses [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR8R4epmS3Q) from 2020'd 9 may parade repetition in Tushino, Moscow.

# The ""Russian GRAD MLRS""

Another reused [footage](https://t.me/nexta_live/16886) by the Nexta telegram channel, claiming that Russia uses GRAD MLRS to attack Ukraine. The [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBqnK8El3Ek) is from 2021 military drills in Russia.

#Larisa Brown's photo reuse

This is a bit different, albeit slightly ironic case of (now failed and deleted) psyops. [Larisa Brown](https://twitter.com/larisamlbrown/), a Defence Editor working at The Times [posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20220304012844/https://twitter.com/larisamlbrown/status/1496984584453599238) a tweet condemning the russian agression, which used a photo of a father crying aqnd hugging his daughter. Ironically enough, the [original video](https://t.me/Prikhodko1970/2768) is from Gorlovka, Donbass, where refugees flee the ukranian forces attacking their cities.

# ""Russian artillery"" bombing Mariupol

This [video](https://www.tiktok.com/@c_b_u_h_o_t_a/video/7068255823457307905) from TikTok claims that russian artillery is shelling Mariupol. While the uncropped timestamp shows the footage is again from 2015, the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTJ8nOWlQE0) not only confirms that the footage predates the invasion by 7 years, but also claims that the shelling of civil areas was done by the ukranian army.

# ""Russian paratroopers dead in Gostomel""

Several fake photos are used as ""proof"" to verify that the paratroopers that landed in Gostomel were killed by ukranian forces. While it is impossible to verify or disprove the event itself, [one of the more popular photos, even tweeted by the Minister of Defense of Latvia](https://i.imgur.com/od7Mz4W.png) ([google cache](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:njJEhqc4zMwJ:https://twitter.com/Pabriks/status/1496946037818281992%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw+&cd=1&hl=ru&ct=clnk&gl=ru)) is actually [from 2019](https://t.me/DonbassYasinovatayanaliniiOgnia/23085), and the bodies are the LDNR-Ukraine civil war.

# ""The second Chernobyl disaster""

These category of fakes claim ([1](https://t.me/voynareal/8971), [2](https://www.saveecobot.com/ru/radiation-maps)) that during the invasion the Chernobyl station was damaged and is leaking radiation. However, the European Radioactivity Data Exchange Platform [doesn't show](http://eea.government.bg/eea/main-site/bg/output/daily/bulletin-en.html) any radiation spikes around Chernobyl.

# ""Russian airplane"" downed in Kyiv

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Unog4HU3Uy8) reposted in social media is supposed to contain footage of a russian jet downed in Kyiv. In fact, it was not a russian jet, but an ukranian jet, [which was later confirmed by CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-25-22/h_92025ead357da99786d9f6a4c45e9bb4).

During the day, the same downed plane photos were used in another [fake](https://t.me/gistapapapa/27473) that claimed Russia used Iskander ballistic missiles to attack Kyiv's civil areas.

# Russians using WWII tanks to kill civilians

That's a strange one. This [video](https://twitter.com/DonJerr84190237/status/1497203058761248774?cxt=HHwWjMC9ofuPkccpAAAA) is reported to be from Ukraine, however it is obvious that the tanks are from the 1930-1940, and even the video is watermarked to be a [historical reconstruction in Tesovo-Netylsky](https://www.visitnovgorod.ru/afisha/tesovo_reconstruction.htm).

# ""Purple lights in windows guiding russian air forces""

This fake ([1](https://t.me/insiderUKR/21697), [2](https://t.me/voynareal/9412)) is by far the dumbest fake in this list. Those photos claim that purple lights in windows are used by spies to guide the russian air forces. However, those are actually [cheap purple grow lights for plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light) that are very popular in Ukraine and Russia.

Another [iteration](https://t.me/voynareal/9417) of the same idea warned against stickers on houses despite them being clearly [theodolite markers](https://geomarket.in.ua/ru/nivoline-a4-254000).

#Ukrainian forces and militia attacking ""russian forces""

Another fake by [Nexta](https://t.me/nexta_live/17545), although later disproved by the same Tg channel. The footage is actually [from 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIp34wW3k90) civil unrest in Kyiv.

# Ukrainian MiG-29 destroying russian Su-35

This fake, [published](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225230731/https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1497170325162934272?cxt=HHwWgIC--c6egscpAAAA) by the Ukrainian MoD, was [disproven by BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/60528276?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&at_custom2=twitter&at_custom4=BE878436-9666-11EC-9CCE-60FB4744363C&at_custom3=%40BBCWorld&at_medium=custom7&at_campaign=64&at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D): the footage is from Digital Combat Simulator World.

# ""Russian saboteurs"" captured in Ukraine

These photos ([1](https://t.me/voynareal/9739), [2](https://i.imgur.com/TQxShPp.png)) are being distributed as proof that a group of russian saboteurs was captured in Ukraine. While, again, it is almost impossible to prove it or disprove it, the weapons seized from the supposed saboteurs are an [ukranian know-how: a Kalashnikov bullpup modification named Maliuk](https://web.archive.org/web/20180103194908/https://modernfirearms.net/ru/avtomaty-shturmovye-vintovki/maljuk/).

A mostly similar [post](https://t.me/nexta_live/18033) in Nexta telegram channel claims that another group of saboteurs was captured - and again, the photos contain the same ukrainian Maliuk automatic rifle.

Another [post](https://t.me/vkusniy_sir/1609) about a supposed captured saboteur demonstrates the insides of his bag, and judging by the photos, supposed ""russian saboteur"" had a pneumatic air gun replica of a Makarov with several CO2 cartridges to defend himself.

# ""Russian Heavy Flamethrower System is being used in Ukraine""

Some Telegram channels [claimed](https://t.me/belamova/25547) that Russia deployed the Flamethrower System [TOS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOS-1). The photo they used, however, can be [traced](https://web.archive.org/web/20201125045400/https://tehnorussia.su/voennaya-tekhnika/26-artilleriya-i-krupnokalibernye-orudiya/288-sistema-tos-solntsepek-printsip-dejstviya-i-opisanie) to articles from 2020.

# Zelensky ""on the frontlines""

The photoset with Zelensky in a helmet, navigating a trench, is widely reported as him being on the frontlines of the war ([1](https://twitter.com/emilykschrader/status/1497102233930022930), [2](https://twitter.com/alexplitsas/status/1496995542378942468)) (archived: [1](https://web.archive.org/web/20220224234856/https://twitter.com/alexplitsas/status/1496995542378942468), [2](https://web.archive.org/web/20220225065251/https://twitter.com/emilykschrader/status/1497102233930022930)). Problem is, these photos were taken in [December of 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20220120050457/https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-president-zelenskiy-holding-talks-with-biden-adviser-says-2021-12-09/).

The same photos and fake claims were [posted by Kim Kardashian](https://i.imgur.com/yOTnnpH.png) in her Instagram stories.

On a side note, there were claims that [even Zelensky's wife](https://i.imgur.com/eBDsNTF.png) is on the front lines, [using photos from Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/nb/image-photo/kyiv-ukraine-august-20-2021-rehearsal-2029715219).

# The ""injured woman""

This famous [photo of an injured woman](https://imgur.com/a/d9gBez0) was widely used by the mainstream media to symbolize the ongoing civilian casualties and suffering. Aside from the weird purple-ish tone of her blood (those things do happen when the colors of photos are enhanced to be more ""aestethically pleasing"" by the editors, like when using Instagram filters), photos with the same woman [resurfaced](https://t.me/panteri_panteri/17136) several days later, where she is posing for another photo, holding a Kalashnikov.

# ""Ukrainian women on frontlines""

A rather popular [post](https://i.imgur.com/b0mAYlq.png) on FB has lots of photos of women that, according to the post author, participate in the war against russian forces. While it is unknown how many women actually participate in the war, most of the photos are staged: taken from older [flashmobs and photoshoots](https://ukraine.segodnya.ua/ukraine/knyazhny-tozhe-voyuyut-v-vsu-zapustili-originalnyy-fleshmob-1412826.html), [other news stories](https://dnr-news.com/dnr/38264-zaderzhannuyu-v-donecke-medsestru-nacgvardii-uvolili-na-ukraine-za-narushenie-discipliny.html) and [old photos from Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSJ0Vkuj5l7/).

# Ukrainians running from ""russian forces""

Several telegram and twitter users posted this [video](https://i.imgur.com/dxT3eSh.png) (now deleted) claiming that the footage is from Kyiv, and people are running from russian forces trying to kill them. In reality, the video is from  a [sci-fi feature film ""Invasion Planet Earth""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEONOBOAkEM).

# ""Ukrainian"" girl shouting at ""russian forces"" to go home

The [video](https://i.imgur.com/J55E6u0.png) of a girl shouting to a soldier was reposted as a ""Brave ukrainian giral confronting Putin's Army"". The [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4FM9WGRWdQ), however, is from 2012 Palestine-Israel conflict.

# Russian forces ""posing as ukranian forces under the flag of Ukraine""

Another fake, [posted](https://twitter.com/GeneralStaffUA/status/1498354038454243332) by the ukrainian MoD. The original [photo](https://i.imgur.com/ZF9ykLh.png) of the same APC clearly shows no ukrainian flag.

# ""Former Miss Ukraine picks up assault rifle and says anyone who crosses border 'will be killed'""

Several news outlets [reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228020153/https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-invasion-former-miss-ukraine-picks-up-assault-rifle-and-says-anyone-who-crosses-border-will-be-killed-12553347) ([2](https://i.imgur.com/5WAs03W.png)) reported that ""Anastasia Lenna, who represented her country in the 2015 Miss Grand International beauty contest, has signed up to defend her home from Russian forces."". However, the photoshoot used in the reports is from 22 of February, before the invasion. Moreover, she is holding an airsoft gun.

# Massive amounts of ""Russian forces with Z symbol are being destroyed""

Several videos from 2014 are being edited and posted to Telegram. The videos from 2014 have the ""Z"" symbol added to the military equipment. Video comparison: [link](https://t.me/warfakes/360?single).

# ""Russian soldiers burning villages""

An easily debunkable [tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228185912/https://twitter.com/MilanCHE111/status/1498372162838745088) that claims that russian forces burned villages and celebrated it with beer. The original [photo](https://sasha0404.me/moi-11-lyubimyx-balkanskix-filma/) is from a serbian film ""Lepa sela lepo gore"" from 1996.

# Ukrainian cat being rescued after shelling by russians

An ukrainian singer [created](https://i.imgur.com/ejx9wTZ.png) an emotional post with a man near lots of rubble, crying and holding a cat. The actual [photo](https://www.turkiyeekspreshaber.com/haberde-insan/4-yil-once-evi-yanan-ali-dede-simdi-kedisiyle-birlikte-yeni-bir-yasam-h10534.html) was taken in Turkey in 4 years ago, when the man's house was destroyed by fire.

# Russia using Tie Fighters in Ukraine

No comment: Israel's Channel 13 News [posted a video](https://t.me/breakingmash/32212) with a Tie Fighter from Star Wars, presented as footage from Ukraine.

# Russian forces ""thwarted"" evacuation, destroying the bridge in Irpin

Photos ([1](https://i.imgur.com/x9Rujz5.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/WUl9zDs.png)) with people trying to cross the rubble and evacuate are being posted with claims that the bridge was destroyed by the russian forces to thwart the attempts of evacuation. However, the official Telegram channel of the Vice Minister of Internal Affairs [posted photos](https://t.me/Pravda_Gerashchenko/323) of the same bridge in Irpin, claiming that it was destroyed to stop the progress of the invasion forces.

# Injured children in Kharkiv

Dimitri Gordon, a ukrainian bloger, [posted](https://t.me/dmytrogordon_official/460) a photo of an injured child, claiming the child was injured by russian forces in Kharkiv. The [original photo](https://www.thesun.ie/news/6702543/children-war-syria-brunt-bloody-conflict/) is from the Syrian conflict, taken in a hospital near Damascus.

# Russian drones destroyed in Chernigiv

Some ukrainian media outlets posted [photos](https://i.imgur.com/XqxL2XN.png) of a drone downed near Chernigiv. The drone on the photo is an ukrainian drone A1-SM ""Furia"" ([wiki](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D1%83%D1%80%D1%96%D1%8F_\(%D0%91%D0%9F%D0%9B%D0%90\))) ([more photos](https://www.google.com/search?q=%D0%B01-%D1%81%D0%BC+%C2%AB%D1%84%D1%83%D1%80%D1%96%D1%8F%C2%BB&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwiy_92un7X2AhVqQEEAHQVCDr4Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=%D0%B01-%D1%81%D0%BC+&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgDMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgQIABAYOgcIIxDvAxAnOgQIABBDOgsIABCABBCxAxCDAToICAAQgAQQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBOgUIABCABDoKCCMQ7wMQ6gIQJzoECAAQHlDHD1jdNmDQRmgBcAB4AIABRYgBjQSSAQE4mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWewAQrAAQE&sclient=img&ei=gKEmYrK_MOqAhbIPhYS58As&bih=927&biw=958))

I don't want the US to get involved as I just don't see it as our fight.  On the flip side I don't mind sending weapons to people defending their country but I freely admit that almost all of the information I've seen is very one sided and I feel our 'elites' are leading us into another war.

1. What are the stated reasons for the invasion?  Do most Russians believe the official reasons or do they believe the war is justified for another reason not being officially mentioned?  Are many Russians against the war?
2. If you could go back to the months before the invasion and talk to Putin what would you tell him to do differently?  How would you advise the military to prepare?
3. What support does Russia offer for Veterans, especially those that have been wounded and disabled?  Is this support adequate?
4. Has this war impacted Putin's popularity?  If it has negatively impacted his popularity does he have any political rivals that may try to take advantage of the situation to 'kick him while he's down'?
5. How do you feel about the military progress when compared to the losses that have been suffered?  Are the losses and progress in line with what you believed they would be at the onset of the invasion?
6. Do the troops that are deployed have many opportunities to write, email, and/or call home?

Lastly but most importantly, very sorry for anyone that has lost anyone, even if you disagree with the war itself you should treat your returning veterans as heroes and support the families that have lost soldiers as much as you can.",268,302,DHerpster,/r/russia/comments/u30geq/looking_for_russian_perspective_on_the_war/,

Holland - 5 days;  
Yugoslavia - 11 days;  
Belgium - 18 days;

Norway - 2 months and 1 day.  
  
Pavlov's house in Stalingrad held out for 58 days. During the defense of Pavlov's house, the defenders killed more Germans than they lost during the capture of Paris.  
The Soviet Union held out for four years (1418 days) and ended the war in the enemy's lair - Germany capitulated.
